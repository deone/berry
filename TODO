- Disable referral input field on confirm page.

What's next?
Write and test:
- For parent during save().
- Signal on save() to inform referrer when a level is initiated and completed.
  For now, this works on save(), implying that a member would not be moved to
  the next level, even if he has attained it (by virtue of his downlines'
  referrals) until his next referral when we would call another save(). We can
  fix this buying running the paybonus script weekly to reward those who have
  completed a level and have not been rewarded.
- Pay a commission on the lower of weekly spend for left and right descendants.
- Members should see a dashboard on logging in.
- Test, Test and Test!!
