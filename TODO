1. It is currently impossible for a member to get to a rank through his referrals
alone except for standard rank. This is because the system automatically makes
new referrals children of leaf nodes. We may need to change this to also allow
child-ing of descendants with one child.

What's next?
- Test model ranking feature.
- Test for parent during save().
- Signal on save() to inform referrer when a level is initiated and completed.
  For now, this works on save(), implying that a member would not be moved to
  the next level, even if he has attained it (by virtue of his downlines'
  referrals) until his next referral when we would call another save(). We can
  fix this buying running the paybonus script weekly to reward those who have
  completed a level and have not been rewarded.
- Pay a commission on the lower of weekly spend for left and right descendants.
- Members should see a dashboard on logging in.
- Test, Test and Test!!
