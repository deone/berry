N.B:
3 categories of subscribers:

- Subscribers before LP launch.
- New subscribers who were not referred.
These ones would be created as members of the loyalty programme on the joining
of their first referree. Since they're either subscribers before the launch or
they joined without referrals, they would have no referrer in the loyalty program.

- New subscribers who were referred.
These would join the loyalty programme as soon as they activate their SIM and
based on some set rules e.g. recharging a certain amount.
If there are set rules, we would need to include them in the joining checks.
The referrer is responsible for getting his referree to sign up to the loyalty
program either via web, SMS or USSD.

Business Rules
==============
1. 1 referral gives N50.
2. 3 referrals left + 3 referrals right plus recharge of N400.
